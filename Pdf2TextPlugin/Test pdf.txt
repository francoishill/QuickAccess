Week of 07 May 2012 
 
Comparing chart solutions: 
 Highcharts: 5dev=$1200 (240pp) 
 TeeCharts: 1dev=$129, $378 incl source 
 
 
Charts implemented in Wadiso 6: 
 Time simulation links: 
o Flow 
o Velocity 
o Headloss 
o Gradient 
o Quality 
 Time simulation nodes 
o Output 
o Head 
o EGL 
o Quality 
 
Performance improvements affecting all reading of results: 
 Used to take 220 seconds (almost 4 minutes) to graph time simulation for nodes, now under a second 
 Time step selection (after time simulation) used to take more than 10 secs, now under a second 
 
Generic progressbar with automatic  calculation of total time and estimated remaining time: 
  
 
Todo this week: 
 Ben topology fixed? 
 Get charts running again 
 Model checklist
